1. Creational design pattern deal with object creation.

- factory: creates an object without specifying the exact class that needs to be created

- abstract factory

- builder

- prototype

- singleton: creates one object and provides a global point of access to it

2. Structural design patterns assemble objects and classes together and help them work together

- Adapter: allow incompatible classes to work together.

- decorator: adds extra functionality to classes without altering the actual behaviour

- facade

- proxy

- composite

3. Behavioral patterns are concerned with communication between objects

- observer: subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about events

- strategy

- command

- state: allows an object to change its behaviour when internal state changes

- chain of responsibility
